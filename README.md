# Queue Data Structure Implementation

This project aims to create a queue data structure by following these instructions:

## Instructions

Write a program where two different queue structures use the same array.

1. **Queue Order:**
   The first queue will try to use the sequence from beginning to end, while the second will use it from end to beginning.

2. **Overlap Prevention:**
   Ensure that queues may not overlap. Implement a mechanism to prevent this.

3. **Variable Queue Sizes:**
   Allow one queue to use more space on the array than the other queue.
